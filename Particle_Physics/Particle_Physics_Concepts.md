## Feynman Diagrams

A Feynman Diagram (FeynD) is a visual representation of a **calculus integral**.
It literally represents a single number: 
the probability of 

### DeltaR

Each outgoing particle has an \eta and \phi. Suppose you have two outgoing particles. You can see how *far apart they are* in deltaR space by calculating: `dR = sqrt( (eta2 - eta1)^2 + (phi2 - phi1)^2)`

- If dR is small, then the particles are close together in **angular space**.
