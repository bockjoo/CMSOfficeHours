# Your Qualifying Exam

_You ready to become a **Ph.D. candidate**?_

- Start preparing your paper and presentation at **least 1 month in advance**.

## Your Paper

- Rule number 1: **_START EARLY!_** (at least a month in advance)
- Work on the paper a little bit each day.
- Aim for 10-15 pages as the [UF Physics website](https://www.phys.ufl.edu/wp/index.php/graduate/)
suggests.
- Use the [UF Ph.D. LaTeX thesis template](https://helpdesk.ufl.edu/application-support-center/etd-technical-support/ms-word-and-latex-templates/).
  - Be sure to change things like "Ph.D. Dissertation" to "Qualifying Thesis"
- Give a rough draft to your committee **at least 1 week** before your presentation date.
  - There will be some back-and-forth with your committee with revisions.
- Don't reinvent the wheel.
  - Look at someone else's qualifying paper to get an idea of what it should look like.

### Typical Structure of a Qualifying Paper

1. Introduction
2. Particle Physics and the Standard Model
3. LHC
4. CMS
5. Your analyses and experience
6. Your plan towards graduation (include a timeline!)

## Your Presentation

- Fully understand **everything you put on your slides**.
  - All material on your slides is **_fair game_** for your committee to quiz you on.
- Less is more.
- When your committee asks, and you don't know, _admit it!_
  - Otherwise your committee will likely see how far you will run in the wrong direction.
- Don't contradict yourself.

## General Knowledge You Should Have Going into Your Qual
