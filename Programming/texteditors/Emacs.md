# Emacs

The key-based navigation of Emacs is also found in **Unix** and **ROOT** command lines.

Once, my friend Maher showed me that he even uses emacs as a _calendar_. Like I said, it's a powerful program.

If you're bored, type `Meta-x butterfly` in emacs and see what happens.

## Commands

Book up emacs: `emacs -nw` (`nw` stands for "no windows")

All Emacs commands have you hold down control key (C) or meta key (M). 
- The meta key on Windows is probably 'Alt' and on Mac is 'Opt'.

Leave the Emacs editor:
C-x, C-c

Scroll page down (up):
C-v  (M-v)

Center page at cursor:
C-l  (that's 'ell')
- Do command again to bring top of page to cursor
- Do command a third time to bring bottom of page to cursor


Move around page:
             C-p
C-b ... cursor ... C-f
             C-n
- Stands for (previous, next, backward, forward)


Move forward () 1 word:
M-f (M-b)
