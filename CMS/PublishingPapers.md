# Life of a CMS Paper

The basic lifetime of a CMS paper is:

```bash
Birth -> Pre-approval -> Approval -> CWR -> Publication
```

---

## Birth

Each analysis begins its life as an idea.
The idea is presented to the corresponding **working group**,
like the Higgs working group or Beyond Standard Model working group.
As the analysis members do more and more initial studies on their idea,
they regularly present to the **conveners** of their working group.
Eventually the analyzers make a proposal presentation to the conveners.
If the conveners approve, then the analysis will be added to **CADI**
(**C**MS **A**nalysis **D**atabase **I**nterface).

*The analysis is now official!*

- Any CMS member can view any analysis within CADI.

---

## Pre-approval

When the conveners decide that the authors have made enough progress on the
analysis, then an **ARC** (**A**nalysis **R**eview **C**ommittee) is formed.
The authors deliver a **pre-approval** talk to the ARC,
summarizing the current status of the analysis.
If the ARC approves the analysis, then the conveners are no longer responsible
for reviewing the analysis; the ARC now takes over.

- Any member from CMS can attend any working group meetings,
the pre-approval talk, etc.

---

## Approval

The authors are now in constant communication with the ARC.
The ARC recommends changes and suggestions.
Once these recommendations have been implemented by the authors,
the documentation is frozen and an **Approval Talk** is given by the authors.
The Physics Coordinator listens to questions after the Approval Talk
and determines if there are more points that need further investigation.
Finally the ARC decides whether or not to approve the analysis.

- If the paper is not yet ready but the analysis would like to be presented
at a conference, then a **P**hysics **A**nalysis **S**ummary (PAS) is made.
- Any member should be able to reproduce the analysis from the paper or PAS.

---

## CWR

As the analysis nears completion, the entire collaboration can suggest changes
to the documentation and question the physics behind it.
This **C**ollaboration-**W**ide **R**eview can happen in parallel with
the Approval Talk or after.

---

## Publication

After the CWR, the paper is approaching the zenith of its life:
the **Final Reading**. This is the last chance for the ARC and other members
to make final suggestions, check for clarity, ensure consistent style, etc.
Once the Publication Committee gives the paper a "blessing",
the documentation is frozen and sent to a journal.

- The paper is then anonymously peer-reviewed.
- The referees then judge the paper and finally the paper may be published.
