# Travel to CERN

You are about to embark on a grand journey across the world to collaborate with international scientists at CERN,
a world-renowned particle physics organization that operates the *largest* and *most powerful* particle collider ever built: **the Large Hadron Collider** - an incredible opportunity indeed!

This is a collection of resources to help you prepare for your trip to CERN.

Here is [Prof. Darin Acosta's very informative presentation](../CERN/ProfDarinAcosta_NewStudentOrientationAtCERN.pdf) on everything you need to know.

## Before your trip

### You'll need

- [ ] a valid passport.
- [ ] a visa.
- [ ] a CERN computing account.
  - Register with the CMS Secretariat.
  - TEAM leader must approve it.
  - Then you'll get an ID number and an email with computer account instructions.
- [ ] your User pre-registration forms filled out online by your institute TEAM leader.
- [ ] proof of medical insurance.
- [ ] a Home Institute Declaration form with travel dates.

### Finding a place to live

These guiding questions will help you determine where to live:

- Where will you be working at CERN?
  - At the Meyrin site? At the Prévessin site? Maybe at CMS itself (Point 5) in Cessy, France?
- Do you like living in a sprawling city (like Geneva) or do you prefer a small and quiet village (like Prévessin)?
- Do you want roommates?

#### Housing in CERN Meyrin

CERN has at least two hostels in which you can stay:

- Bât 38: Small rooms but has a "community feel". Communal kitchen, communal bathrooms and showers.
- Bât 41: Fancier, but more expensive. You get your own bathroom.
- Apartment/house
- "CMS House"

--- Can try to rent a place in 
----- SGPMeyrin Village or 
- if Prevessin site (bldg 904 work, CSC work, GIF++, muon beam tests), then check out Residhome.
- if P5 (Cessy, CMS):
--- Gex?
--- CMS communal house

What to do when you first arrive:
- Get to your new home and rest!

### Advice for your flight

If this is your first long flight, 

## While at CERN

Upon landing at the Geneva airport (aeroport de genève), you will likely be *exhausted*.
Your first task is to get checked into your home and get some rest!
